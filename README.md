This is going to be a project where I make a website for recipes. 
To be honest, I'm just following what The Odin Project tells me to do.
A lot of these things are hard to do off the top of my head.
But I'm sure practice makes perfect.
Anyways I hope this website turns out to be badass in the future. 
(Also I have no idea if I did the merging with the git repository correctly. I still 
struggle to understand the whole remote commands and repository concepts and whatnot.)
